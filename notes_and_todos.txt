We still have to look closer on modules/fa/fa.py:
Firstly check if the input values for different names on the chain is necessarry
, since we might be able to pull all of that off using the parser I wrote
Also check if the pased tokens get the correct values in the database
Also check if the gosecurity checker is reasonable since it is king of handcoded
